# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease using various machine learning models. The models are trained on a structured dataset containing various medical parameters.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Max Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of the ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease Present)

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
